# Preparing for a $YAYO airdrop

_Last updated: May 23, 2021_

This guide will make sure you are ready to sign up for a $YAYO airdrop.

Only step 1 is required for you to be able to use your wallet address in the
sign-up and _receive_ $YAYO.

However, in order to _view_ your $YAYO balance and _trade with it_, you need
to complete steps 2 and 3.

## 1. Create a MetaMask Wallet

Download the
[browser extension](https://metamask.io/download.html) or the
[iPhone](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/metamask/id1438144202) or
[Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.metamask) apps.

**(!!!) Make sure you save your seed phrase and your password in a safe place.
Without your seed phrase you won't be able to restore your wallet if you lose
your device. (!!!)**

After setting up MetaMask, you can copy your public wallet address by clicking
the text starting with `0xSomething` just below your account name. This is the
address you will enter into the airdrop form.

## 2. Connect to the Matic network

**If you are on browser**, visit [QuickSwap](https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap)
and hit _Connect to a Wallet_. QuickSwap will add the network automatically.

**If you are using MetaMask on iPhone/Android, or the network wasn't added
automatically**, add the network manually in your wallet by going to _Settings_,
then _Network_, click _Add Network_ and fill in the following values:

| Field                           | Value                                   |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Network Name                    | Matic Network                           |
| Network URL                     | https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com      |
| Chain ID                        | 137                                     |
| _Currency Symbol (optional)_    | MATIC                                   |
| _Block Explorer URL (optional)_ | https://explorer-mainnet.maticvigil.com |
|                                 |                                         |

## 3. Display your $YAYO balance

Open MetaMask and make sure you are on the **Matic Network** (look in the top
right corner), then click _Add Token_. Where it says _Token Contract Address_,
paste the following address: `0xf7058856f405542cd660e8ce4751248F2d037f2B`.
